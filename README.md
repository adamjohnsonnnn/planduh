Brief Story:

When starting Dev Bootcamp I worked on a PC using Linux. I obtained a Mac through another DBC student, continued my work on here but was still under his alias (Matthew-Black) when commiting for projects. Since DBC's closing, some of previous projects have been lost and I am pushing up what I have worked on both solo and paired. My final project for PlanDuh was deployed and can be viewed at: www.planduh.com
